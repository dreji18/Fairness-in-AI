Description: # Fairness-in-AI
        Detecting Bias and ensuring Fairness in AI solutions
        
        This is a collective pipeline comprises of 3 Transformer models to de-bias/reduce amount of bias in news articles. The three models are:
        - An English sequence classification model, trained on MBAD Dataset to detect bias and fairness in sentences (news articles). This model was built on top of distilbert-base-uncased model and trained for 30 epochs with a batch size of 16, a learning rate of 5e-5, and a maximum sequence length of 512.
        - An Entity Recognition model, which is is trained on MBAD Dataset to recognize the biased word/phrases in a sentence. This model was built on top of roberta-base offered by Spacy transformers.
        - A Masked Language model, which is a Pretrained model on English language using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective.
